# Watch Later Sync (Chrome MV3)

Unpacked Chrome extension that scrapes `youtube.com/playlist?list=WL` while you are logged into YouTube, then POSTs progress to this project's `/api/sync`.

The Google Sheet is **seed only**. This extension is the live write path. Opening a video in the library does **not** mark it watched.

## Load unpacked

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension/` folder in this repo (the folder that contains `manifest.json`)

You can also unzip `extension/watch-later-sync.zip` and load that folder the same way.

## First-time setup

1. In Vercel → Storage, create a **Blob** store for this project (Hobby is enough). That injects `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`.
2. In Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables, add `SYNC_SECRET` (any long random string) for Production and Preview.
3. Redeploy so the API can see both values.
4. Open the extension popup:
   - **Library URL**: `https://youtube-watch-later.vercel.app` (or a preview URL)
   - **Sync secret**: the same `SYNC_SECRET`

## Sync

1. Stay signed into YouTube in Chrome
2. Click **Sync Watch Later**
3. The extension opens or focuses the Watch Later playlist, reads the WL playlist contents (not a generic tree-walk), follows Innertube continuations past the first ~100 videos, and records `playlistVideoRenderer.index`, progress bars, and `publishedTimeText` / videoInfo dates, then upserts by video id
4. Refresh the site. Videos gone from Watch Later keep their last snapshot and appear under **Dropped**. A truncated scrape does not mass-drop the rest of the library.
